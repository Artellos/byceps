**BYCEPS** is the *Bring-Your-Computer Event Processing System*.

It is a tool to prepare and operate a LAN party, both online on the

attendees.

The system incorporates both experience from more than 15 years of
organizing LAN parties as well as concepts and source code developed
for more than a decade.
